 #  üîê JWT Auth Lab: Securing a Dummy Controller with Spring Boot

SpringJWTAuthLab is a lightweight Spring Boot application designed to help understand how to secure REST APIs using 
JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and Spring Security. It focuses on protecting a dummy controller without requiring a full database 
setup or complex user management.

This lab is ideal for beginners exploring how stateless authentication works in modern Java applications. 
I built and test endpoints with authentication and authorization layers, all while learning how JWT integrates with 
Spring Security in a simple and approachable way.
